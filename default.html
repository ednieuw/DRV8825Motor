<br />
NEMA17 with DRV8825 and 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor with ULN2003<br />
<br />
There is one sketch and with a #define the motor type / driver is selected.<br />
A rotary encoder controls the microstepper mode and rotation speed. <br />
<br />

Driver Board Connection<br />
IN1 Pin 8 Arduino<br />
IN2 Pin 9 Arduino<br />
IN3 Pin 10 Arduino<br />
IN4 Pin 11 Arduino<br />
– GND power supply<br />
+ 5 V power supply<br />
<br />
The motor power supply is 5V and be connected to + and GND to -. You can use a 
USB 5V power supply of 1A<br />
Stepper motor coils are connected with a connector.<br />
<br />
The Arduino is powered via the USB-cable<br />
IN1-IN4 are connected to pin 8, 9 ,10 and 11<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The rotary encoder is connected to Arduino pin 2, CLS, 3 DT, 4 SW, + to 5v and - 
to GND<br />
<br />
CLK Pin 2 Arduino<br />
DT Pin 3 Arduino<br />
SW Pin 4 Arduino<br />
– GND pin Arduino<br />
+ 5V pin Arduino<br />

DRV8825 Connections<br />
DRV8825 Connection<br />
VMOT 8 - 45 V<br />
GND Motor ground<br />
SLP 5 V<br />
RST 5 V<br />
GND Logic ground<br />
STP Pin 3<br />
DIR Pin 2<br />
A1, A2, B1, B2 Stepper motor<br />
<br />
The motor power supply shall be connected to VMOT and GND (top right).<br />
Stepper motor coils shall be connected to A1, A2, B1, and B2 as indicated in the 
pinout diagram.<br />
<br />
The GND pin (bottom right) must be connected to the microcontroller ground 
reference. VDD shall be connected to the 5 V logic supply.<br />
The STP (step) and DIR (direction) pins are connected to digital pins 3 and 2, 
respectively. Alternate digital pins may be used if defined accordingly in 
software.<br />
<br />
The RST (reset) and SLP (sleep) pins must be tied to 5 V to enable the driver.<br />
The EN (enable) pin is internally pulled low and may remain unconnected. When 
driven high, the driver is disabled.<br />
<br />
The FAULT output is an open-drain signal that asserts low when the H-bridge FETs 
are disabled due to overcurrent protection or thermal shutdown. This pin is not 
utilized in this configuration.</p>
